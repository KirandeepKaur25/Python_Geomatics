Geomatics
This program uses a dictionary to store student names and scores. It provides a menu-driven interface with options to add student scores, view student scores, calculate the average score, find the maximum and minimum scores, and exit the program. The program uses a while loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit and conditional statements to process user choices. Basic error handling is implemented to handle invalid menu choices.
